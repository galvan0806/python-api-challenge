### Humidity vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot

The r-value is -0.306 suggests that there is a minimal negative correlation between latitude and humidity in the southern hemisphere

### Cloudiness vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot

The r-value of -0.157 suggests that there is moderate negative correlation between latitude and cloudiness in the southern hemisphere

### Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot

The r-value of -0.147 suggests that there is a minimal negative correlation between latitude and wind speed in the southern hemisphere

## VacationPy
The second task, utilizes the data from the first sub_cahallenge as a CSV. The challange locates hotels using the a Geoapify API for Cities to plan a vacation!
